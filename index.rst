====================================
The plumCore DAQ framework
====================================

A modular framework for data logging and remote data acquisition.

The name represents a seed found in a plum fruit - the core of the plum.
Although not used in this manner it sounds sufficiently good to be used
as a name for a totally unrelated project.
