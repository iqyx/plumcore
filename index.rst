====================================
The plumCore (IoT) framework
====================================

A modular framework for data logging, remote data acquisition
and low power wireless mesh networks.

The name represents a seed found in a plum fruit - the core of the plum.
Although not used in this manner it sounds sufficiently good to be used
as a name for a totally unrelated project.
